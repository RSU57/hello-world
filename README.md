Hello-World Tutorial from Github

This is my first time working with GitHub, but I am excited to learn how to integrate this into my various Computer Science classes at RSU57. My background is in applied physics and japanese, so though language use is not difficult, I'm still very much a newbie at working with code and its various integrated systems. Please take care of me!
